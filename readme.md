Fantasy Roster Optimization with Evolutionary Algorithm
=======================================================

This is pretty basic at the moment, but this script will take some arbitrary fantasy metrics, like fantasy ranks, DK points, or any other arbitrary weighting mechanism and optimize them subject to hard constraints (i.e. Salary Cap). It uses an EA-based approach and has room for loads more optimization. However, this serves as a starting point.

*TODO*
- Add better evolutionary matching
- Add soft constraints. For example, I might like a set of 10 rosters with 25% exposure to the Cowboys v Giants game, and 50% of my roster coming from games starting before 1 PM.
